# Pause-state-machine
Leave the GameState and GameStateManger script as it is and dont attatch it to anything.
Put the code that is in YourScripts.cs into any script that you want to be affected by the pause.
The code in the changeState script is to put anywhere when you want to pause/unpause but do not put it in the same scipt that has the code from yourScript.cs inside.
